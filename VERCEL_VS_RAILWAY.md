## ðŸš€ Recommendation: **Use Railway**

**Why Railway is better for XavierOS/Lucy:**

1. **Full-Stack App** - Lucy needs backend services (WCAG analysis, PDF generation, etc.)
2. **Database Included** - PostgreSQL built-in
3. **Already Deployed** - Your code is already there
4. **Better for APIs** - Integration services (Google Maps, HubSpot, Gmail)

**Vercel is great but:**
- Better for static sites and serverless functions
- Would need external database (Neon, Supabase)
- More complex setup for full-stack apps
