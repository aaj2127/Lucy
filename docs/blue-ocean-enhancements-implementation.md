## Environment Variables

All features use the existing environment variables. No new variables are required.

**Current Variables** (from `src/server/env.ts`):
```
NODE_ENV=development
BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173
ADMIN_PASSWORD=<set_this>
JWT_SECRET=<set_this>
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<required_for_ai_features>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<optional_for_payments>
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<optional_for_payments>
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<optional_for_payments>
DEFAULT_COMMISSION_RATE=0.70
REFERRAL_REWARD_AMOUNT=10
```

**Critical Variables**:
- ✅ `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: **REQUIRED** for all AI-powered features (scenarios, segmentation, partnerships, etc.)
- ✅ `JWT_SECRET`: Already required for authentication
- ⚠️ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Optional but needed for marketplace monetization

**No Changes Required**: The application works with current environment variable configuration.

## API Usage Examples

### Generate Cross-Industry Scenarios
```typescript
const scenarios = await trpc.generateCrossIndustryScenarios.mutate({
  token: userToken,
  opportunityId: 123,
  goals: "Increase market share while reducing costs",
  targetIndustries: ["Gaming", "E-commerce"],
  count: 3
});
```

### Create Blue Ocean Canvas with AI
```typescript
const canvas = await trpc.createBlueOceanCanvas.mutate({
  token: userToken,
  name: "Healthcare Disruption Strategy",
  description: "Targeting underserved rural markets",
  marketId: 456,
  generateSuggestions: true
});
```

### Generate Dynamic Segments
```typescript
const segments = await trpc.generateDynamicSegments.mutate({
  token: userToken,
  marketId: 789,
  segmentationType: "jobs_to_be_done",
  count: 5
});
```

### Analyze Trend Intersections
```typescript
const intersections = await trpc.analyzeTrendIntersections.mutate({
  token: userToken,
  marketId: 123,
  autoSelect: true
});
```

### Suggest Partnerships
```typescript
const partnerships = await trpc.suggestPartnerships.mutate({
  token: userToken,
  opportunityId: 456
});
```

### Generate Pitch Deck
```typescript
const pitchDeck = await trpc.generatePitchDeck.mutate({
  token: userToken,
  opportunityId: 123,
  scenarioId: 789,
  format: "investor",
  theme: "professional"
});
```

### Predict Value Migration
```typescript
const migrations = await trpc.predictValueMigration.mutate({
  token: userToken,
  marketId: 123,
  industries: ["Healthcare", "Technology"]
});
```

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **AI Generation**: All AI-powered features use OpenRouter API which may take 5-30 seconds depending on complexity
2. **Database Indexes**: Proper indexes added for frequently queried fields
3. **JSON Fields**: Used for flexible data structures (ERRC factors, analogies, etc.)
4. **Pagination**: Consider adding pagination for large lists (challenges, submissions)

---

## Security Notes

1. All procedures verify user authentication via `authenticateUser()`
2. User can only access their own data or data they have explicit access to
3. Marketplace transactions require payment verification
4. Challenge submissions linked to user accounts

---

## Blue Ocean Strategy Alignment

These features align with Blue Ocean Strategy principles:

✅ **Value Innovation**: Canvas builder, cross-industry scenarios
✅ **Market Creation**: Value migration tracker, trend intersections
✅ **Non-Customers**: Dynamic segmentation targeting unserved groups
✅ **Strategic Moves**: Partnership suggester for ecosystem creation
✅ **Execution**: Pitch deck generator for investor readiness

---

## Conclusion

**8 out of 10 features** are fully implemented on the backend with database support. The remaining 2 features (Marketplace and Challenges) have complete database schemas and just need frontend implementation.

All AI-powered features leverage the existing OpenRouter integration and follow established patterns in the codebase.

The implementation enables Blue Ocean Explorer to truly become an engine for market creation and blue ocean discovery, not just competitor analysis.
