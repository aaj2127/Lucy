# ERRC Framework for Blue Ocean Explorer

This document contains 30 ERRC-informed (Eliminate, Reduce, Raise, Create) meta questions to guide product development, user research, and strategic innovation for the Blue Ocean Explorer app.

## Overview

The ERRC framework helps identify opportunities to:
- **Eliminate**: Remove unnecessary features or friction
- **Reduce**: Minimize complexity or effort required
- **Raise**: Enhance existing capabilities beyond industry standards
- **Create**: Develop entirely new value propositions
